# Mission-to-Mars

### Overview
The goal was to build an app in order to scrape mars data from the different websites and create an html page to show Mars facts, latest news, and its hemispheres.

### Bootstrap 3 Components
I implemented the mobile responsive attribute as well as the hover table and setting the mars hemispheres pictures as thumbnails.
